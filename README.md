**JS is inlined into each HTML file** — no separate app.js, converter.js, etc. `store.js` is the only shared script because it's loaded by every page.

## Data Storage

All data is stored in `localStorage` on the user's device:

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `gloveson_settings_v1` | App settings (trucks, rounding, materials, features) |
| `gloveson_log_v1` | Daily log entries array |
| `gloveson_notes_v1` | Notes array |
| `gloveson_log_prefs_v1` | Log UI preferences (OT rule, pay period) |
| `gloveson_last_timekeeper` | Last-used timekeeper name |

Old key `gloveson_fieldcalc_settings_v1` is automatically migrated on first load.

---

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript — no frameworks, no build step
- `localStorage` for persistence
- Deployable to any static host (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

---

## Deploy

```bash
# Cloudflare Pages (recommended)
# Connect repo, set build command to none, output directory to /

# Or drag-and-drop the folder to Netlify Drop
```

## Roadmap / Future Ideas

### Hourly Wage & Paycheck Estimator (Daily Log v2)
- Add optional hourly wage field to pay period setup (saved per user, never required)
- Estimated gross pay displayed on the summary card: regular hours × rate + OT hours × (rate × 1.5)
- Estimated check display (gross only — no tax math, clearly labeled "estimate before deductions")
